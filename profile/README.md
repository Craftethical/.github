# About CraftEthical

CraftEthical is a development agency that works with "good actors" to create a better web for everyone, there are a lot of bad development practices out there, we want nothing to do with those.

## Bad actor examples

 - Ad networks who allow adverts using extreme dark patterns (such as fake close buttons or fake OS popups [low battery, etc])
